Here's a Python script that functions as a simple Windows application uninstaller. 
This script will list installed applications and allow you to select one to uninstall using Windows' built-in uninstaller.

Python Script: Windows App Uninstaller

python

import subprocess
import wmi

def list_installed_apps():
    c = wmi.WMI()
    installed_apps = []
    
    for app in c.Win32_Product():
        installed_apps.append({
            'name': app.Name,
            'identifying_number': app.IdentifyingNumber
        })
    
    return installed_apps

def uninstall_app(app_id):
    c = wmi.WMI()
    app = c.Win32_Product(IdentifyingNumber=app_id)
    
    if app:
        app[0].Uninstall()
        print(f"Uninstalling {app[0].Name}...")
    else:
        print("Application not found.")

def main():
    installed_apps = list_installed_apps()
    
    if not installed_apps:
        print("No installed applications found.")
        return
    
    print("Installed Applications:")
    for index, app in enumerate(installed_apps):
        print(f"{index + 1}. {app['name']}")
    
    choice = int(input("Enter the number of the application to uninstall: ")) - 1
    
    if 0 <= choice < len(installed_apps):
        app_id = installed_apps[choice]['identifying_number']
        confirm = input(f"Are you sure you want to uninstall {installed_apps[choice]['name']}? (y/n): ")
        
        if confirm.lower() == 'y':
            uninstall_app(app_id)
        else:
            print("Uninstall canceled.")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

How to Use the Script

    Install WMI module: Before running the script, ensure you have the WMI module installed. 
	You can do this by running:

bash

pip install WMI

Save the script: Copy the code into a text editor and save it as app_uninstaller.py.

Run the script: Open Command Prompt as Administrator, navigate to the folder where you saved the script, and run:

bash

    python app_uninstaller.py

    Uninstall Applications: The script will list installed applications. 
	Enter the number of the application you wish to uninstall and confirm the action.

Key Features

    List Installed Apps: The script retrieves a list of installed applications using WMI.
    Uninstallation: It allows users to uninstall an application based on the application's identifying number.
    User Confirmation: It asks for confirmation before proceeding with the uninstallation.

Important Notes

    This script should be run with administrator privileges to uninstall applications.
    Uninstalling applications can be irreversible; make sure you are sure about the uninstallation.
